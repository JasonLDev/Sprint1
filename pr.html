<body style="margin: 70px;">
  <p>
    Today im gonna show what makes Puerto Rican cuisine absolutely Next level so i hope your ready but before i show you some incredible recipes heres a brief history on the history of puerto rican food.
  </p>
      <h2><u>History</u></h2>
<p>Puerto Rican cuisine is a product of diverse cultural influences, including Taíno Arawak, Spanish Criollos, and Africans.It is characterized by a unique blend of Spanish seasonings and ingredients, which makes it similar to Spanish and other Latin American cuisines.Locally, it is known as cocina criolla. 
    The roots of traditional Puerto Rican cuisine can be traced back to the 15th century. In 1848, the first restaurant, La Mallorquina, was opened in Old San Juan. The island's first cookbook, El Cocinero Puerto-Riqueño o Formulario, was published in 1859.</p>
<h2><u>Recipes</u></h2>
   <p>
So there is two dishes that i think of when i think of Puerto Rican food and that is Rice, Beans, Chicken and some sweet plantains or tostones(the flat ones!).Im gonna provide you with the recipe and a tutorial on how to do it with some really fantastic home cooks or renowned chefs.
    </p>
    <h2><u>Rice, Beans, Chicken and Plantains.</u></h2>
    <h4>
    <u>These are the ingredients</u>
    </h4>
    <p>
4 Tbsp cooking oil, divided ($0.16)
1 packet sazón ($0.17)
1/2 cup salt pork, small dice ($1.83)
1 onion, diced ($0.42)
1 Tbsp garlic, minced (about 3 cloves) ($0.14)
8 oz tomato sauce ($0.59)
4 Tbsp sofrito ($0.72)
1 tsp Better Than Bouillon, Roasted Chicken Base* ($0.12)
2 Tbsp distilled white vinegar ($0.07)
1 large sweet potato, large dice ($0.74)
1 green bell pepper, diced ($0.79)
2 15 oz. cans kidney beans, drained ($1.68)
2 cups white medium grain rice, rinsed ($0.76)
3 cups boiling water ($0.00)
2 tsp salt, plus more to taste ($0.05)
    </p>
    <h4>
        <u>These are the instructions</u>
        </h4>
     <p>Add 2 tablespoons of cooking oil to a medium-sized heavy-bottomed pot over medium-high heat. Once it has warmed, add the salt pork and sazon. Fry until the fat has rendered and the salt pork is golden, about 4 minutes.
        Lower the heat to medium and add the onion. Cook for 2 minutes, then add the garlic. Cook for 1 minute until fragrant.
        Add the tomato sauce, sofrito, chicken bouillon, and vinegar. Cook for 5 minutes over medium heat, reducing the sauce and developing the flavors.
        Add the green bell pepper and the sweet potato. Cook for five minutes.
        Add the beans and enough water to cover them. Stir and taste the broth. Add salt to taste.
        Cook uncovered over medium heat for 20 minutes until the sweet potato has softened. If halfway through the cook, the liquid in the beans reduces too much, add 1/4 cup of water.
        For the rice, set a heavy-bottomed pot over medium heat and add 2 tablespoons of oil. When the oil has warmed, add the rice, mix it into the oil and let it toast for a minute. Next, add the boiling water and 2 teaspoons of salt to the rice and stir.
        Cook uncovered until the water begins to evaporate and you see little steam holes form over the surface of the rice, about 5 minutes. Stir the rice once, reduce the heat to low, and cover the pot tightly with a heavy lid, so steam does not escape.
        Cook the rice without stirring until the grains are tender, about 15 to 20 minutes. After you portion out the rice, scrape up the crispy bits on the bottom of the pot to serve on top of your rice.
        To serve, scoop a 1/2 cup of rice into a bowl and top it with a 1/2 cup of beans. If you want to take it one step further, garnish with fresh cilantro leaves and add a few slices of ripe plantain on the side.

<h2><u>Flan</u></h2>
<h4>
<u>These are the ingredients</u>
</h4>
<p>
    3/4 cup granulated sugar ($0.18)
    1 orange, zested into thick strips and juiced ($0.78)
    1 14oz. can sweetened condensed milk ($1.99)
    1 12oz. can evaporated milk ($1.50)
    1 cup heavy cream ($1.50)
    1 bay leaf ($0.10)
    1 pinch salt ($0.01)
    4 large eggs ($0.36)
    1 Tbsp vanilla extract ($1.74)
</p>
<h4>
    <u>These are the instructions</u>
    </h4>
 <p>
    Preheat the oven to 450°F. Find a baking sheet large enough to accommodate a 9-inch pie dish or cake round with a flat top. It must lay flat for the flan to come out of it and onto a serving dish without breaking.
Set a light-colored sauce pot over medium heat and add the sugar and 1/4 cup of orange juice. (If the orange didn’t release a ¼ cup of juice, make up the difference with water.) Heat the sugar and melt it until it turns light golden brown, then take the pot off the heat. The sugar will continue to brown off the heat. Do not stir the sugar, which can cause it to recrystallize and get grainy. Instead, swirl the pan.
Pour the hot sugar syrup into the 9-inch pie dish or cake round, coating the bottom in an even layer. Set aside.
Add the sweetened condensed milk, evaporated milk, heavy cream, bay leaf, strips of orange zest, and a pinch of salt to a medium pot. Heat until steaming, then take off the heat, cover, and steep for 20 minutes.
When the milk mixture has finished steeping, beat 4 eggs with 1 tablespoon of vanilla in a large bowl. Pour the steeped milk mixture through a fine mesh sieve into the egg mixture and mix. Do not whip; you don't want to incorporate air into the liquid.
Meanwhile, bring 2 quarts of water to a boil for the water bath. Pour the milk and egg mixture into the prepared 9-inch pie dish or cake round, then place the pie dish or cake round onto the baking pan. Place the baking pan in the oven and fill halfway with boiling water to surround the pie dish or cake round, creating a water bath.
Lower the temperature of the oven to 350°F. Bake the flan for 60 to 70 minutes until the custard has set but still jiggles like thick lava in the middle. Let the flan cool completely. Then, place it in the fridge to set for at least 8 hours.
To serve the flan, run a knife around the edges of the pan. Then, top the 9-inch pie dish or cake round with the serving plate and carefully flip it over. Tap the baking dish gently to help the flan release. When you hear the flan release from the pie dish, remove the pie dish carefully and let caramel sauce flow over the flan.
